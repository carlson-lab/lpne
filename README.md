### TO DO
1. add normalization options
2. n networks with n-class prediction?
3. implement window overlap?
4. remove bad windows
5. more unit tests
6. consolidate plot_factor.py and plot_power.py
7. add docstrings for channel maps
9. Add a Tucker decomposition model? <- could be a good way to separate
   between-mouse differences
10. PoE?
11. Plot LFPs
12. Manually remove regions from LFPs
